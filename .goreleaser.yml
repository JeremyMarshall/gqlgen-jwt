  # If your Dockerfile copies files other than the binary itself,
  # you should list them here as well.
  # Note that goreleaser will create the same structure inside the temporary
  # folder, so if you add `foo/bar.json` here, on your Dockerfile you can
  # `COPY foo/bar.json /whatever.json`.
  # Also note that the paths here are relative to the folder in which
  # goreleaser is being run.
  # This field does not support wildcards, you can add an entire folder here
  # and use wildcards when you `COPY`/`ADD` in your Dockerfile.
